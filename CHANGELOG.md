# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- JobTrack Companies, Jobs, Applications, status history, Interviews, and
  owner-scoped Dashboard domain
- Explicit Application state machine with atomic history and concurrent
  transition serialization
- Timezone-aware Interview scheduling, overlap checks, and upcoming queries
- PostgreSQL GiST exclusion constraint preventing concurrent scheduled
  Interview overlaps across API processes
- Interview creation restricted to Applications in active recruitment stages
- Short-TTL Dashboard cache-aside with PostgreSQL fallback and write
  invalidation
- Real PostgreSQL/Redis integration suite covering ownership, rollback,
  concurrency, caching, and failure behavior
- JobTrack architecture, ADRs, demo tooling, interview guide, query-plan audit,
  and authenticated CRUD load-test profile
- Multi-stage production container image with locked runtime-only dependencies,
  non-root execution, liveness healthcheck, Compose migrations, and CI smoke tests
- Explicit trusted-proxy IP/CIDR allowlisting for Uvicorn client-address
  resolution, with canonical client IPs shared by rate limiting and request logs
- Administrative account disable/re-enable lifecycle with immediate access
  rejection and atomic refresh-session revocation
- Optional Redis-backed fixed-window rate limiting shared across API processes
- Privacy-preserving HMAC client identifiers, atomic counters, and bounded TTLs
- Explicit fail-closed/fail-open outage policies with readiness and metrics
- Redis services for local Compose and CI integration coverage
- Optional PostgreSQL transactional outbox for durable lifecycle-email delivery
- Horizontally scalable workers with leases, retries, dead-letter handling,
  encrypted payloads, graceful shutdown, and bounded telemetry
- Optional Redis cache-aside for validated public OIDC discovery and JWKS data
- Bounded cache keys, TTLs, refresh locks, manual invalidation, and signing-key
  rotation refresh without caching identity or authorization decisions

- Optional OpenTelemetry distributed tracing across FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, HTTPX,
  Redis, and transactional outbox worker execution
- W3C Trace Context propagation through bounded outbox metadata, JSON log
  `trace_id`/`span_id` correlation, OTLP/HTTP export, sampling controls, and
  secret-redaction safeguards
- Reproducible PostgreSQL benchmark harness with deterministic isolated fixtures,
  sync/async query parity, latency percentiles, pool telemetry, and JSON output
- CI correctness smoke coverage for the asyncpg prototype and rollback semantics
- Architecture decision retaining synchronous SQLAlchemy for v1.3.0 until
  representative measurements justify a separately scoped migration
- Guarded k6 load-testing profiles for health baselines, authenticated reads,
  and isolated per-virtual-user refresh-token rotation
- Explicit workload error-rate and p95/p99 starting thresholds plus a staged,
  repeatable measurement guide for controlled environments

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Optional normalized email identities during backward-compatible registration
- Single-use, hashed, expiring account-action tokens for email verification
- Enumeration-resistant verification request and atomic confirmation endpoints
- Explicit disabled/SMTP delivery boundary and verification configuration
- Enumeration-resistant password recovery with scoped, hashed reset tokens
- Atomic password updates with refresh-session revocation
- Refresh-token families with rotation-replay detection
- Authenticated device-session listing and idempotent family revocation
- Optional TOTP MFA with encrypted seeds and replay-resistant verification
- Hash-only, single-use recovery codes and opaque MFA login challenges
- Access-token authentication-method and authentication-time claims for step-up hooks
- Provider-neutral OIDC Authorization Code login with PKCE S256, state, nonce,
  strict ID-token validation, and explicit account linking
- Hash-only browser-bound OIDC transactions and immutable issuer/subject identities

### Changed

- Registration conflicts now return a controlled `409` response
- SMTP delivery supports separately configured verification and reset URLs
- Login accepts a bounded device label and logout revokes the full token family
- MFA-enabled login now requires a short-lived second-factor challenge; refresh
  tokens do not preserve recent-MFA status
- Existing local accounts are never silently linked by matching provider email;
  identity changes revoke refresh sessions

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Dedicated liveness and database-backed readiness probes
- Prometheus request count, status, latency, and in-progress metrics
- Structured JSON logs with validated request correlation IDs
- Monitoring, alerting, multi-worker metrics, and troubleshooting guidance
- Branch-aware test coverage reporting with a 90% CI gate and XML artifact
- Expanded admin, CORS, exception, rollback, refresh-token, and rate-limit tests
- Cross-platform setup, database, server, migration, and quality-gate commands
- Local development workflow and troubleshooting guide
- Copy-paste API authentication, authorization, health, and metrics examples
- Architecture guide covering request flow, security, data, and observability
- Deployment-pattern and safe release-sequence guidance
- Automated validation for internal documentation links

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Ruff linting and formatting checks
- Dependency auditing as an enforced CI gate
- PostgreSQL 17 service for migrations and tests in CI
- Wheel build and import smoke test
- Package URLs, classifiers, and release metadata
- Explicit current limitations and a release checklist

### Changed

- Prepared package version 1.0.1
- Reworked README around value, quick start, architecture, and evidence
- Replaced deprecated `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` with `uvicorn-worker`
- Replaced the deprecated `httpx` test dependency with `httpx2`
- Replaced Passlib's unmaintained bcrypt adapter with direct bcrypt calls while
  retaining compatibility with existing bcrypt hashes
- Updated contribution, deployment, and roadmap documentation
- Moved funding configuration to `.github/FUNDING.yml`

### Fixed

- Closed the README project-structure code block that hid subsequent sections
- Aligned the documented Python requirement with Python 3.13
- Included the `app` package in built wheel artifacts
- Removed hard-coded application version strings
- Removed a CI security-audit command that could silently succeed after failure

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- FastAPI application architecture
- PostgreSQL database integration with SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- JWT access-token authentication
- Hashed refresh tokens with rotation and revocation
- bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based authorization
- CORS, security headers, rate limiting, and request logging
- Health checks and global exception handling
- Authentication and token-security test suite
- GitHub Actions CI
- Initial deployment and community documentation
